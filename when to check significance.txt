WHEN TO USE TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE:

when there is dynamicity(mostly using samples(as the sample keeps changing)) in the test statistic we proceed to check the significance of that test statisitc.
so to gain the confidence even when there is dynamicity in the data.

ex : 
1) checking the significance of correlation.
2) checking the significance of R squared value.
3) checking the significance of beta coeffients.
4) checking the significance of VIF values

But before checking the significance, think whether it has any objective
(ex : should the VIF values should be tested for significance?)

STEPS FOR TESTING SIGNIFICANCE:
1) SETTING THE OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS
ex : 
1)H0-correlation b/w DV and IV is zero, H1-correlation  b/w DV and IV is not zero.
2)is R squared1 is different from another.(chow-test while structural break occurs)

2)finding the sampling distribution for the measure(R2 or VIF or r) in hand.(challenging task)

3)finding the test statistic.

4)finding the P value.

5)Taking Decision.


BONUS:
CHECKING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CORRELATION BETWEEN DV and IV

formula - t = R*SQRT((n-2)/(1-Rsq))

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS : H0-correlation between DV and IV is zero,H1-correlation between DV and IV is non zero.
SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION : T- distribution.
