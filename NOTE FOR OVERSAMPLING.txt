method 1)oversampling only the minority class will lead to overfitting.

method 2)instead of this, if we oversample both minority and majority class,
the rate at which the majority class is increasing will be less compared to first method, so low overfitting.

but if the majority class is too much then we can increase minority class to a reasonable proportion, like(60-40)

50-50 is not recomended as we tend to give eqaul importance to both classes where fruad or minority class should be kept low proportion only.
