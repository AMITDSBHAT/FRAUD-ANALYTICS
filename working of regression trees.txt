REGRESSION TREES:
consider 
TARGET: continuous variable 
PREDICTORS : all continuous variables

STEP1 : choosing the best variable for splitting
algorithm runs through first variable, iterates through all the values to choose the best value to split to get most homogeneous split.
This splitting value is stored somewhere.
Algorithm now goes through all the variable, iterates through all the values and chooses the best value for spliiting and stores it.
Algorithm now compares all these stored splits and chooses the best variable.
Using that split mean(y) will be calculated for that region.

STEP2:algorithm chooses the next best variable to split and same procedure continues.

NOTE: REGRESSION TREES ONLY CALCULATE THE MEAN OF Y BUT NOT THE REGRESSION LINE, 
PAIRWISE REGRESSION CREATES REGRESSION LINES AT DEFINED REGIONS OR PARTITIONS OF X VALUES.
